Recovery image doesn't work without kernel modules that allow for USB mass storage access into initrd, meaning we must put the recovery image on an sdcard or something similar.

# bootloader installer

On some systems, the only python dependency is the `systemd-boot-builder.py` script.
If we implement this ourselves, we can get rid of this dependency as well as implement some features that have yet to be implemented upstream (e.g. boot counting).

# updating

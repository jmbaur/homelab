# WARNING

This is a highly opinionated set of NixOS modules for building a router/firewall
device configuration. It works for me, but is not at all indented to be generic
enough to work for others.

These modules were originally just part of my router's configuration, so some of
the settings are still dependent on that specific device. These settings are
slowly being factored out.
